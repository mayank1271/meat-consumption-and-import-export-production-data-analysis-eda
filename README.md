This notebook is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and "Data Cleaning" project focused on a dataset related to meat production ,import and export  data from the OECD-FAO for the years 2021-2030. The dataset contains information about various agricultural commodities, their production, consumption, exports, and imports across different countries. The notebook follows a structured approach to analyze and clean the data, ensuring it is ready for further analysis or modeling.

 Key Steps in the Notebook:

1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection:
   - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using `pandas`.
   - Basic information about the dataset is displayed using `data.info()`, which shows the structure, columns, and data types.
   - The first 20 rows of the dataset are displayed to get a sense of the data.

2. Data Exploration:
   - The notebook uses the `skimpy` library to provide a detailed summary of the dataset, including statistics for numerical and categorical columns.
   - The dataset contains 28 columns, including information about the structure, commodity types, time periods, observation values, and more.

3. Data Cleaning:
     - Removing Duplicate Columns**: Columns like `Time period`, `Observation value`, and others are dropped as they are either duplicates or not useful for analysis.
     - Handling Null Values**: 
     - For the `TIME_PERIOD` column, null values are handled by converting the column to numeric and removing rows with outliers.
     - For the `OBS_VALUE` column, null values are filled with the mean value of the column.
     - Similarly, null values in `UNIT_MULT` and `DECIMALS` columns are filled with their respective mean values.
     - Renaming and Standardizing Values: 
     - The `Commodity` column is standardized by renaming "Eggs, in shell, preserved or cooked" to "Egg".
     - The `Reference area` column is standardized by renaming "China (Peopleâ€™s Republic of)" to "china".

4. Data Transformation:
   - The `TIME_PERIOD` column is converted from float to integer to represent years properly.
   - Outliers in the `TIME_PERIOD` column are identified and removed.

5. Final Dataset:
   - After cleaning, the dataset is left with relevant columns such as `STRUCTURE_ID`, `STRUCTURE_NAME`, `Reference area`, `Commodity`, `Measure`, `TIME_PERIOD`, `OBS_VALUE`, and others.
   - The dataset is now ready for further analysis, such as time series analysis, trend analysis, or predictive modeling.

Key Insights:
- The dataset contains information about agricultural commodities like Pigmeat, Poultry meat, Sheepmeat, Beef and veal, and Eggs.
- The data spans from 2009 to 2030, with observations for different countries and regions.
- The `OBS_VALUE` column, which represents the observation value (e.g., production, consumption), has been cleaned by filling null values with the mean.
- The `TIME_PERIOD` column has been cleaned by removing outliers and converting it to integer format.

Tools and Libraries Used:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization (though not extensively used in this notebook).
- Skimpy: For generating a detailed summary of the dataset.

Potential Next Steps:
- Visualization: Create visualizations to explore trends in agricultural production, consumption, and trade over the years.
- Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical tests to identify significant trends or patterns.
- Predictive Modeling: Build models to forecast future agricultural production or consumption based on historical data.
